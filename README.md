# Shopify Theme Locales

A shared, open-source library of e-commerce translation strings for Shopify themes.

Instead of translating common strings like "Add to cart" or "Out of stock" from scratch in every theme, use this library as a starting point. Translations are community-maintained and automatically kept in sync across languages using Azure AI Translator.

## Supported Languages
